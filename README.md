# Computer Graphics Lab Project: Interactive 3D Room Visualization

This repository contains the source code and assets for an interactive 3D room visualization project developed as part of the CSE4204-Computer Graphics Lab course at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. The project aims to demonstrate fundamental concepts of computer graphics and interactive 3D environments under the guidance of instructors Rakib sir and Reasad Zaman.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive 3D Scene**: Explore a fully interactive 3D room environment rendered in real-time.
- **Object Interactions**: Use mouse clicks to interact with objects in the scene, such as opening the book cover.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Navigate through the scene and manipulate camera views using intuitive keyboard controls.
- **Realistic Rendering**: Experience high-quality rendering of room elements including the table, bookshelf, sofa, chair, and more.
- **Educational Purpose**: Developed to reinforce concepts learned in the Computer Graphics Lab course, including lighting, shading, texturing, and user interaction.

## Technologies Used:
- WebGL: A JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser.
- Three.js: A JavaScript library that makes it easy to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.
3. Run the application and interact with the 3D scene using mouse clicks and keyboard controls.
